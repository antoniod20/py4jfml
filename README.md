# Py4JFML
A python library for using JFML


To use this library in UNIX-based systems you need to follow this steps.
  
  
  1. If you don't have setuptools installed on your machine, you must run:
  
    $ sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
  
  
  2. Then, after downloading Py4jfml, you need to install the library locally. 
  Navigate to the directory '../py4jfml-master/Py4jfml' and run:
  
  	$ pip install .
  
  
  3. Finally, you need to run setup.py to update PYTHONPATHs and dependencies in python3.
  You should do this every time you edit file setup.py:
  
  	$ sudo python3 setup.py develop
  
  
  


Now you are ready to use Py4jfml library.
